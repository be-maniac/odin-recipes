        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast 
                halves - pounded thin</li>
            <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a shallow dish, mix together the 
                garlic powder, pepper, salt, paprika, 
                bread crumbs and flour. In a separate 
                dish, whisk together the milk and egg.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the oil in an electric skillet 
                set to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Dip the chicken into the egg and milk, 
                then dredge in the dry ingredients until 
                evenly coated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fry chicken in the hot oil for about 
                5 minutes per side, or until the chicken 
                is cooked through and juices run clear. 
                Remove from the oil with a slotted 
                spatula, and serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
